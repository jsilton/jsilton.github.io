I was fortunate to participate in two sessions at SuperNova South 2015 in Atlanta, GA on October 9th. My presentation was about how mobile SEO and usability becomes the new fronteir of optimizaiton. In addition, I moderated a panel of local SEO peers about where we are headed as an industry and how Google is evolving in both the near and extended future.

## Mobile, The New Frontier of SEO - Optimizing Mobile Websites & Usability

Google changed the game this spring. They announced an algorithm update before it went live. App indexing, mobile usability, and site speed are all critical for mobile SEO and an optimized digital presence. Yet, in a world where mobile devices outnumber computers 3-to-1, many businesses still treat mobile as a separate experience and runner-up to their "main" site.

In this session, I explored the mobile search landscape, how the search results page is evolving, and how to stay ahead of the curve.

## The Future of SEO (Panel)

How is the landscape of SEO shifting? Our thoughtful panel of SEO experts discussed and debated the topics and trends that will pervade the SEO industry over the next few years.

I moderated the panel of four speakers including Alicia Anderson (SEO Manager at WebMD), Jenny Munn (SEO Consultant at The Munn Group), Nate Shivar (Consultant at Shivar Web Consulting LLC), and Stephanie Wallace (Director of SEO, Nebo).
