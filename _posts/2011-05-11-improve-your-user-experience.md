This afternoon, [@EvanLaPointe](https://twitter.com/evanlapointe) posted an article to Atlanta Analytics about why organizations don’t need content development strategies. The article takes a similar stance to my recent post on [designing a website for growth](/articles/website-redesign-and-iteration), which dove into the challenges that organizations face when declaring they are going to redesign their site. It seems like a lot of the problems with website development projects arise from the process of making changes rather than the reason or decision to make improvements.

Evan says it much more elegantly, but why can’t we just improve a site so users have a better experience? Read more in his post about [how to craft an effective content development strategy](http://www.atlantaanalytics.com/about-web-analytics/how-to-craft-an-effective-content-development-strategy/).
