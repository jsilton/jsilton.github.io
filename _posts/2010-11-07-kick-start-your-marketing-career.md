Do you know what all the ads are doing on the top and right side of the search results?

At this point, almost everyone uses the internet, and most internet users use search engines to navigate the web, find information, and purchase goods. The goal of most search engines is to deliver the most relevant results for each query. Do you feel that your company or product is relevant for certain search queries?

If you are trying to kickstart your marketing career, it is very important that you understand search engine marketing. In many organizations you will be hard pressed to find someone who is knowledgable about search engine marketing. Not only that, very few people can say they are experts. If you’d like to show your initiative and become an expert in one portion of online marketing, take the [Google Advertising Fundamentals Exam](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/path/18128-google-ads-search-certification).

According to the exam website, the fundamentals exam is designed to cover “basic aspects of AdWords and online advertising, including account management and the value of search advertising”. It’s not just a test on how to use AdWords. In fact, the exam only scratches the surface of AdWords and its functionality. The fundamentals exam is really a course on how online advertising works on Google. How do the ads get there? Why should I click on a paid ad? How can I know the ads are safe? Are the ads relevant to my search?

This AdWords exam is only one of the exams Google offers. They also have training and testing centers for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/) and [Google Apps](https://cloud.google.com/certification/gsuite). You don’t even have to go with Google. If you would rather get a certification from Microsoft, you could take the [adExcellence exam](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/training/get-certified).

Gaining expertise in search marketing can help differentiate yourself from other job applicants and employees in your future workplace. If you don’t want to pay the $50 for the exam, all the learning materials are available for [free online](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/path/18128-google-ads-search-certification).
