Welcome to my blog at JordanSilton.com. This is the first entry and the start of my personal blog. I’m not sure where it will take me, but I am definitely excited to start writing, develop a focus, and ultimately enjoy the experience publishing work online.

This blog is a work in progress, and I hope everyone reading will be part of this journey with me. Please feel welcome and encouraged to share your own thoughts and comments. Let’s get started!
