Updating a bio can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to finding the right words to convey your message and highlight your skills and achievements. That's why I recently turned to ChatGPT for some assistance. As a language model trained to interact in a conversational way, I knew ChatGPT would be able to help me brainstorm ideas and find the perfect words to use in my updated bio.

I started by pasting in my current bio and asking ChatGPT to rewrite and enhance it. Then, I fed it more information about myself, including details from my LinkedIn profile, transcripts from interviews, and blog posts I had written. I also asked ChatGPT to give me multiple versions of the same content and selected the one that sounded the best to continue.

Here's an example of how ChatGPT was able to improve my original bio:

Before: "Hi, I'm Jordan. I have a passion for developing exceptional teams, building innovative products, and solving complex business problems."

After: "Jordan Silton is a highly skilled and accomplished product executive with a proven track record of driving business growth through innovative solutions and exceptional team building."

In this case, ChatGPT was able to shift the focus from my personal interests to my specific skills and achievements, and it also changed the perspective from first person to third person. As a result, the revised version communicates my value as a product executive much more effectively.

Another example:

Before: "I am VP, SEO for Angi (NASDAQ: ANGI). In this role, I lead the organic growth vision, strategy, and execution for both homeowners and pros."

After: "As VP, SEO at Angi (NASDAQ: ANGI), Jordan leads the product growth efforts for homeowners, utilizing his expertise in search engine optimization, editorial content, analytics, and customer experience."

Here, ChatGPT added more detail about my specific role and the skills I bring to it, which helps to paint a clearer picture of my work and what I can offer.

Overall, I was very impressed with ChatGPT's performance. It was able to generate ideas on its own and follow instructions, and it had a great recall of all the information I provided it. Plus, it was able to tie everything together in a cohesive and compelling way.

Of course, there were a few challenges along the way when using ChatGPT to update my bio. As I mentioned earlier, I did run into some timeouts due to high volume from other users, and I had to be careful not to ask for too much content at once (ChatGPT limits the amount of characters it returns).

However, these were minor issues that were easily solved by adjusting my approach or being more mindful of the amount of content I was requesting. The biggest challenge I faced was actually getting started – it can be intimidating to put yourself out there and write about yourself, especially when you're trying to make a good impression.

But once I got into the flow of things, using ChatGPT to update my bio was actually a lot of fun. It was great to have a little extra help coming up with ideas and finding the right words to convey my message, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well ChatGPT was able to follow my instructions and recall the information I provided it.

In the end, I'm very happy with the result – a polished, compelling bio that I'm excited to share on my website. I think ChatGPT is a fantastic tool for writers and content creators who need a little extra help, and I would definitely consider using it again in the future.

So, if you're struggling to come up with ideas or find the right words for a project, consider giving ChatGPT a try. It's a great way to augment your own writing skills and produce polished, compelling results. Who knows – you might even have a little fun in the process. (And, yes, I did use ChatGPT to help write this too.)
